In the midnight heavens burning
	Thro’ ethereal deeps afar,
Once I watch’d with restless yearning
	An alluring, aureate star;
Ev’ry eye aloft returning,
	Gleaming nigh the Arctic car.

Mystic waves of beauty blended
	With the gorgeous golden rays;
Phantasies of bliss descended
	In a myrrh’d Elysian haze;
And in lyre-born chords extended
	Harmonies of Lydian lays.

There (thought I) lies scenes of pleasure,
	Where the free and blessed dwell,
And each moment bears a treasure
	Freighted with a lotus-spell,
And there floats a liquid measure
	From the lute of Israfel.

There (I told myself) were shining
	Worlds of happiness unknown,
Peace and Innocence entwining
	By the Crowned Virtue’s throne;
Men of light, their thoughts refining
	Purer, fairer, than our own.

Thus I mus’d, when o’er the vision
	Crept a red delirious change;
Hope dissolving to derision,
	Beauty to distortion strange;
Hymnic chords in weird collision,
	Spectral sights in endless range.

Crimson burn’d the star of sadness
	As behind the beams I peer’d;
All was woe that seem’d but gladness
	Ere my gaze with truth was sear’d;
Cacodaemons, mir’d with madness,
	Thro’ the fever’d flick’ring leer’d.

Now I know the fiendish fable
	That the golden glitter bore;
Now I shun the spangled sable
	That I watch’d and lov’d before;
But the horror, set and stable,
	Haunts my soul for evermore.
