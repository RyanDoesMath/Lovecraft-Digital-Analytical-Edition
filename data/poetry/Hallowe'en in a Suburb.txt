The steeples are white in the wild moonlight,
	And the trees have a silver glare;
Past the chimneys high see the vampires fly,
	And the harpies of upper air,
	That flutter and laugh and stare.

For the village dead to the moon outspread
	Never shone in the sunset’s gleam,
But grew out of the deep that the dead years keep
	Where the rivers of madness stream
	Down the gulfs to a pit of dream.

A chill wind weaves thro’ the rows of sheaves
	In the meadows that shimmer pale,
And comes to twine where the headstones shine
	And the ghouls of the churchyard wail
	For harvests that fly and fail.

Not a breath of the strange grey gods of change
	That tore from the past its own
Can quicken this hour, when a spectral pow’r
	Spreads sleep o’er the cosmic throne
	And looses the vast unknown.

So here again stretch the vale and plain
	That moons long-forgotten saw,
And the dead leap gay in the pallid ray,
	Sprung out of the tomb’s black maw
	To shake all the world with awe.

And all that the morn shall greet forlorn,
	The ugliness and the pest
Of rows where thick rise the stones and brick,
	Shall some day be with the rest,
	And brood with the shades unblest.

Then wild in the dark let the lemurs bark,
	And the leprous spires ascend;
For new and old alike in the fold
	Of horror and death are penn’d,
	For the hounds of Time to rend.
